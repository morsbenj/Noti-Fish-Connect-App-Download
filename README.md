Noti-Fish Connect Beta App Download

current version: Newest app version of all versions right now.. more intuitive and visually appealling splash screen,
		and now scan screen should be able to show some dialouge that can give some guidance for
		gettign connected

		*scan screen will now not display any devices that are not Noti-Fish Devices
		so, it is essentially impossible to even test the connectability
		anymore without having your own Dinger device.

Note: this download is for android mobile users only and has only been tested on the
newest Sumsung Galaxy devices, and briefly tested on Google Pixel with an emulator.


HELP WITH DOWNLOAD:
As the website states near the download button, download the contents of this repository, 
or what should just be the file titled: 
  "NotiFishConnect_Installer.apk"
  [make this download directly to the device you want to testtest out the app on.]

If you are not very familiar with how to work with the file system on your Android
device, that is okay, just make sure you are paying attention when the download
completes. There is almost always a little pop-up window near the bottom of the screen
in your Samsung web browser that shows you the file that was just downloaded. Click
on this pop-up or the option for it that says "open" before the pop-up does away
(This way your don't have to go through the trouble of finding where the downloaded 
file went on your device..... if your android device does not already have the 
'Android Package Installer' application, it will likely prompt
you if you want to also install this. Yes, install the android package installer and/or whatever 
other software is required to complete this download process.This will be useful for 
downloading any other android beta apps in the future and will help your device understand 
what to do with an update to this application if we put one out.

*One last thing to note: there will be likely be 1 or more Samsung system warnings that come up,
warning you thatt he package you are installing is from an unknown source and author. This
is okay, and there is really no way to avoid this, without offering this app on the actual
app store, where we are not quite ready to start taking on liability 
that comes with being on the apple or google play store.
