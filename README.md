Noti-Fish Connect Beta App Download
current version: The Native version that was developed with MIT App Inventor
(this version has the most controls implemented, and only utilizes one major
'Page' object) if you are wondering why the app looks so janky and unprofessional,
it is because it is not even a cousin of the project that will be the final app
for Android and Apple. Like I said, it is a much more useful testing tool because it does far less
object-passing and behaves more more like a simple BLE radio controller with some controls, once initialized. 
There is also far less work that needs to be done order to save the file and it is nice how it was developed
with an online editor. Still waiting on those guys to release full BLE capabilities for iOS devices..
in which case it would be worth considering using MITAI to obtain the first stable release for the mobile that
gets things going and allows us to start selling the soonest. For now, this is just a prototpye that rarely
gets much work done on it anymore, save for proof of concept tests that yield MITAI functionality good
enough for it to be worth adding the new .apk offered up by the download button on the Noti-Fish Website.

Note: this download is for android mobile users only and has only been tested on the
newest Sumsung Galaxy devices, and briefly tested on Google Pixel with an emulator.


HELP WITH DOWNLOAD:
As the website states near the download button, download the contents of this repository, 
or what should just be the file titled: 
  "NotiFishConnect_Installer.apk"
  [make this download directly to the device you want to testtest out the app on.]

If you are not very familiar with how to work with the file system on your Android
device, that is okay, just make sure you are paying attention when the download
completes. There is almost always a little pop-up window near the bottom of the screen
in your Samsung web browser that shows you the file that was just downloaded. Click
on this pop-up or the option for it that says "open" before the pop-up does away
(This way your don't have to go through the trouble of finding where the downloaded 
file went on your device..... if your android device does not already have the 
'Android Package Installer' application, it will likely prompt
you if you want to also install this. Yes, install the android package installer and/or whatever 
other software is required to complete this download process.This will be useful for 
downloading any other android beta apps in the future and will help your device understand 
what to do with an update to this application if we put one out.

*One last thing to note: there will be likely be 1 or more Samsung system warnings that come up,
warning you thatt he package you are installing is from an unknown source and author. This
is okay, and there is really no way to avoid this, without offering this app on the actual
app store, where we are not quite ready to start taking on liability 
that comes with being on the apple or google play store.
