then click on download connect beta app, then use the android download button to make it happen automatically


otherwise, if you insist on downloading it directly from this page, then you should navigate to 
this github page WITH YOUR SMARTPHONE where this text file must have been found, located at 
https://github.com/morsbenj/Noti-Fish-Connect-App-Download
 once there, click on the NotiFishConnect_Installer.apk file, then the option for 'Raw' which will essentially 
 begin the download process for your smartphone of the app code, given that you are using an android device to do so.



2/6 Changes:
This app should now work with the dinger v3.0 as well as the 2.0, however
	the options for the number of channels has been decreased to 50

The Roll call is now much faster because it does not wait the full 3 seconds for
	each device anymore. Instead it continues whenever it gets a response
